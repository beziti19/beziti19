Supported file system 

1. ext4 (Fourth Extended File System)

• Overview: ext4 is a journaling file system that is widely used in Linux-based operating systems, including Tizen. It is an evolution of the earlier ext3 file system, providing improvements in performance, reliability, and scalability.

• Features:

  • Journaling: This feature helps protect data integrity by keeping a log of changes that will be made. In case of a crash or power failure, the system can recover more gracefully.

  • Support for Large Files: ext4 supports files larger than 2 TB and volumes up to 1 EB (exabyte), making it suitable for modern applications with large data requirements.

  • Performance Improvements: It includes features like delayed allocation and multiblock allocation, which enhance performance, especially with large files.

  • Backward Compatibility: ext4 is backward compatible with ext3 and ext2, allowing for easier upgrades.

Why it supports??

 Performance and Reliability: ext4 is a journaling file system, which means it provides better data integrity and recovery options. This is crucial for devices where reliability is paramount, such as smart TVs and home appliances. The performance enhancements over previous versions (like ext3) make it suitable for handling large applications and multimedia content.

• Support for Large Files: With the increasing size of media files (like 4K videos), ext4's ability to handle very large files makes it an ideal choice for modern applications that require substantial storage.

• Scalability: ext4 can support large volumes, which is essential for devices that may require extensive storage solutions without compromising performance.

• Backward Compatibility: By supporting ext3 and ext2, Tizen can easily upgrade existing systems without losing data or requiring complex migration processes.

2. FAT (File Allocation Table)

• Overview: FAT is one of the oldest file systems still in use today and is known for its simplicity and wide compatibility.

• Features:

  • Compatibility: FAT is supported by virtually all operating systems, making it ideal for removable media like USB flash drives and SD cards.

  • Simplicity: The structure of FAT is straightforward, which makes it easy to implement and manage.

  • Limitations: FAT32 (the most common version) has a maximum file size limit of 4 GB and volume size limit of 8 TB.

Why it supports??

• Simplicity and Compatibility: FAT's straightforward design allows for easy implementation across a wide range of devices. Its compatibility with nearly all operating systems makes it an excellent choice for removable media such as USB drives and SD cards, which are often used in Tizen-powered devices.

• Legacy Support: Many older devices and systems still rely on FAT, so supporting this file system ensures that Tizen can interact with a broader array of hardware and software environments, facilitating easier data transfer and sharing.

3. exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table)

• Overview: exFAT is an extension of the FAT file system designed to address the limitations of FAT32, particularly for flash drives and SD cards used in modern devices.

• Features:

  • Support for Large Files: exFAT can handle files larger than 4 GB, making it suitable for high-definition video files and large applications.

  • Optimized for Flash Memory: It is designed specifically for flash storage, reducing wear and improving performance on such devices.

  • Compatibility: Like FAT, exFAT is widely supported across different operating systems, including Windows and macOS, making it a good choice for external storage.

Use Cases in Tizen

• Smart TVs: Tizen OS is commonly used in smart TVs where ext4 is often utilized for the internal storage due to its performance and reliability.

• Wearables: Devices like smartwatches may use FAT or exFAT for external storage options to ensure compatibility with other devices.

• IoT Devices: In IoT applications, the choice of file system may depend on the specific requirements of the device, including storage capacity and data access patterns.

Why it supports??

• Handling Large Files: exFAT addresses the limitations of FAT32 by supporting files larger than 4 GB. This is increasingly important in today's digital landscape, where high-definition video and large applications are common.

• Optimized for Flash Storage: Given that many Tizen devices use flash memory (e.g., smartphones, smart TVs, wearables), exFAT is designed to work efficiently with such storage types, enhancing performance and longevity.

• Cross-Platform Compatibility: Like FAT, exFAT is widely recognized across different operating systems, making it suitable for external storage scenarios where users may need to move files between Tizen devices and other platforms like Windows or macOS

The combination of these file systems in Tizen OS allows it to cater to a wide range of devices and applications. The choice between ext4, FAT, and exFAT typically depends on factors such as performance needs, storage capacity, and compatibility requirements with other devices.

The selection of these file systems reflects Tizen OS's focus on flexibility, performance, reliability, and compatibility across various device types. By incorporating ext4 for internal storage needs and FAT/exFAT for external storage solutions, Tizen can effectively meet the demands of modern applications while ensuring ease of use for consumers. This multi-faceted approach allows Tizen to serve a diverse ecosystem of devices—from smart TVs to wearables—while maintaining robust performance and user-friendly features.
