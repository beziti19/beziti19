<h2>History of tizen</h2>

 <p>The journey of Tizen OS began in 2005 when Nokia developed a platform based on Debian GNU/Linux, which included the Maemo operating system and its accompanying Software Development Kit (SDK). </p>
 <p>In February 2010, Nokia and Intel Corporation announced a significant collaboration, merging the Maemo platform with Intel's Moblin, a "mobile Linux" initiative. This partnership resulted in the creation of MeeGo.</p>

 <p>However, in February 2011, Nokia shifted its focus by partnering with Microsoft to establish a global mobile ecosystem, opting to use the Windows Operating System for its devices. This decision left Intel without a major mobile hardware partner, ultimately leading to the abandonment of MeeGo in favor of a new project: Tizen.</p>

 <p>On February 25, 2013, Samsung made a pivotal announcement regarding its mobile strategy. The company decided to retire its Bada operating system (with "bada" meaning "ocean" in Korean) and merge its features and functionalities into Tizen. </p>

 <p>Today, Tizen is hosted by the Linux Foundation, with its development being fully open and guided by a technical team comprised of experts from both Intel and Samsung. This collaborative effort aims to create a versatile and adaptable platform that serves a wide range of devices, from smartphones to IoT </p>

<h2>Objective of Tizen OS </h2>

 <p>Tizen  provides an application framework based on JavaScript. JavaScript is strong especially in IoT devices, since it has enormous developer community support and a fast development cycle.</p>

 <p>1. Cross-Device Compatibility: To enable a seamless user experience across various device categories by providing a unified platform that allows applications to run on multiple devices without extensive modification.</p>

 <p>2. Developer Empowerment: To facilitate application development through support for multiple programming languages and frameworks, particularly emphasizing web technologies like HTML5, thereby encouraging innovation and creativity in app design.</p>

 <p>3. Modularity and Flexibility: To offer a modular architecture that allows manufacturers to customize the operating system according to their specific requirements and use cases, enhancing adaptability in different markets.</p>

 <p>4. Enhanced User Experience: To deliver an intuitive and responsive user interface that meets the needs of diverse users while ensuring accessibility and ease of use.</p>

 <p>5. Robust Security: To prioritize security through features such as sandboxing, secure boot, and regular updates, ensuring the protection of user data and maintaining trust in the platform.</p>

 <p>6. Ecosystem Growth: To foster a vibrant ecosystem of applications and services that enrich the user experience, encouraging developers to create and distribute innovative solutions through the Tizen Store.</p>

 <p>7. Support for Emerging Technologies: To adapt to the evolving landscape of technology by integrating support for new standards and innovations in areas such as IoT, artificial intelligence, and connectivity.</p>

 <p>8. Software Updates

For home appliance products, Tizen RT supports the proprietary software update mechanism developed by Samsung. As Tizen RT becomes an open source project, non-Samsung devices running Tizen RT require the software update service as well. To support non-Samsung devices, Tizen RT plans to support OMA lightweight M2M (LWM2M)-based FOTA in 2017. ARTIK Cloud already supports LWM2M.</p>

 <p>9. Fault Tolerance

IoT platforms face a challenge in the large-scale device management of deployed IoT devices. System reliability has become a key success factor for IoT platforms. If a critical bug in device drivers or other system components occurs, the whole system inevitably crashes in the case of a traditional monolithic kernel. A clear solution is needed to overcome this challenge; however, typical Tizen RT target devices have only an MPU (memory protection unit). Without an MMU (memory management unit), protecting the system from faults is much more difficult. To provide MPU-based fault isolation, Tizen RT pursues 4 approaches:

<li> Per-thread memory protection</li>

<li> Microkernel architecture</li>

<li> Self-healing</li>

<li> Live update</li></p>

 <p>Assuming the completion of all these features, Tizen RT can be safely protected from any kind of faults.</p> 
 For example, even though a network component encounters a critical error, this fault can be identified by memory protection and isolated by the microkernel architecture. The network component can be restarted by self-healing without any effect on the entire system. If that component is not self-healed eventually, it can be updated by live update through software updating.

 <p>10. Memory Protection

Tizen RT supports not only flat build, but also memory-protected build. The former can help to reduce the memory usage at the expense of memory vulnerability. The latter can be achieved at the cost of about 20~30% increase of memory usage. Which mode is more suitable for low-end IoT devices depends on the trade-off analysis, considering software requirements and hardware limitations.</p>

 <p>User/kernel space separation has already been achieved. The entire memory map is divided into user and kernel spaces. The kernel space is exclusively accessed by the kernel only. Any user tasks which illegally attempt to access this memory region raise an exception. In this mode, the kernel executes with privileged permissions while user threads execute with unprivileged, restricted permissions, as shown in the following figure. Per-thread memory protection is expected to be implemented in the first half of 2017.</p>

 <p>The user thread is executed in the unprivileged mode with restricted permissions. When multiple threads are running, the scheduler preempts the currently-running task and brings the new ready-to-run thread for execution. The stack/data region of thread A is protected from being written by thread B even after thread A is preempted by thread B. This per-thread protection can be realized by the MPU which stores and restores the MPU context of every thread at every context switch.</p>
installation process for Tizen OS primarily involves installing Tizen Studio, the dedicated development environment, and then installing the necessary tools and SDKs within it. You can also install Tizen SDK through Visual Studio. For Samsung TVs, you may need to install third-party apps using USB or by enabling developer mode and allowing installation from unknown sources. </p>

 <h3>Vertualizatin in modern OS </h3>

What is Virtualization?

<li>Think of virtualization like having a magic box that allows you to create multiple smaller boxes inside it. Each of these smaller boxes can run its own operating system and applications, just like having different computers, but they all share the same physical hardware. This technology helps us make the most out of our computers without needing a bunch of separate machines.</li>

Why Use Virtualization?

<li>Better Use of Resources: Imagine you have a big pizza (your physical computer) and you want to share it with friends (the virtual machines). Instead of everyone getting their own pizza (separate computers), you cut it into slices (virtual machines) so everyone can enjoy it without wasting food.</li>

<li>Safety and Isolation: Each virtual machine is like a separate room in a house. If one room gets messy (like an application crashes), it doesn’t spill over into the other rooms. This keeps everything running smoothly and securely.</li>

<li>Easily Expandable: If you suddenly need more space for guests (more applications or users), you can easily build another room without needing to buy a new house. Similarly, you can create new virtual machines quickly as your needs grow.</li>

<li>Cost Savings: By using virtualization, you’re not buying multiple houses (computers) but rather making better use of your existing one. This saves money on hardware, electricity, and maintenance.</li>

<li>Safe Testing Environment: If you want to try out a new recipe (application), you can do it in one of those smaller boxes without messing up your main kitchen (main system). This way, you can experiment without any risk.</li>

<li>Easy Recovery: If something goes wrong, like a storm damaging your house, having those smaller boxes means you can quickly move them to a safe place or restore them easily without losing everything.</li>

How Does It Work?

<li>The Hypervisor: Think of this as the magic that makes everything possible. It sits between your physical hardware (the big pizza) and the virtual machines (the slices). It decides how much of the pizza each slice gets and makes sure they all get what they need.</li>

<li>Virtual Machines: These are your smaller boxes or slices of pizza, each with its own setup. They can run different operating systems and applications, just like how you might have different flavors of pizza.</li>

<li>Guest Operating Systems: Each virtual machine can have its own flavor—Windows, Linux, etc.—allowing you to use whatever suits your needs best.

 <li>Resource Management: The hypervisor is like a good host at a party, making sure everyone has enough to eat and drink. It allocates resources like CPU and memory to each virtual machine based on what they need at any given time.</li>

<li>Management Tools: These are like the party planners who help you keep track of everything—ensuring that all your virtual machines are running smoothly and that you can easily set up or shut down as needed.</li>

<li>Virtualization is like having a smart way to make the most out of your computing resources. It allows you to run multiple systems on one machine, providing flexibility, safety, and efficiency. Whether for business or personal use, virtualization helps us do more with less, making our digital lives easier and more productive!</li></p>

    <h2>2. System Call</h2>
    <p>
      <details><h3>lstat() system call</h3>

lstat() function will control all the system status and returns the information about a special link called a symbolic link. stat() & fstat() function gives the information about the particular file, but the lstat() function refers to a link which points the particular file.

Syntax

The syntax of lstat() function is –
int lstat(const char *path, struct stat *buf);
Here inside the lstat() function, we will pass two parameters as an argument.

The first parameter of the function is a path that gives information about its identification and the probable or actual source of the file.

Another parameter is buff which gives information about the address to the stat structure. This stat structure holds all the updated information about the particular file, which is pointed by the *buf pointer.

The Structure of lstat() Function</p>
The system called lstat() function returns a structure called stat structure. The data members of that stat structure are:

<li> st_mode: the file permissions and file type information.
</li>
<li>st_ino: Information about the inode.</li>

<li>st_dev: the device name.</li>

<li> st_uid: getting the identification of the source file.</li>

<li> st_gid: getting the group of identification of the source file</li>

<li>st_size: the size of the file.</li>

<li> st_atime: mentioning the last time of the used file.</li>

<li>st_ctime: mentioning the time of changing the metadata of the file. Example: file name change.</li>

<li>st_mtime: mentioning the time to change the content of the file.</li>

<li> st_nlink: mentioning the number of the directory entry.</li>

<li>st_blocks: counting the number of used blocks (512 bytes).</li></p>
  
      Macros
        The lstat() function has stast struction, which contains several types of macros. These macros help the lstat() function to recognize the type of files. The name of these macros is:
 <p>• S_ISBLK(): test for a block special file.

• S_ISCHR(): examine if the file is a character device file.

• S_ISDIR(): file type is a directory.

• S_ISFIFO(): inspection related to pipe in the system.

• S_ISREG(): examine the commonly used file.

• S_ISLINK(): examine the soft link.

• S_ISSOCK(): examine if the file is a socket.</p>

   The lstat() function in Unix-like operating systems is used to retrieve information about a file or a symbolic link. Unlike stat(), which follows symbolic links, lstat() returns information about the link itself.

 <p>1. Include Headers: We include <stdio.h> for input/output functions, <stdlib.h> for general utilities, <sys/stat.h> for the stat structure and lstat() function, and <unistd.h> for POSIX operating system API.

2. Check Arguments: The program expects one argument (the filename). If not provided, it prints usage instructions and exits.

3. Call lstat(): The lstat() function is called with the filename and a pointer to a struct stat. If it fails, it prints an error message using perror().

4. Print Information: If successful, it prints various attributes of the file, including size, number of links, inode number, and file type.

5. File Type Determination: The program uses macros like S_ISREG, S_ISDIR, etc., to determine the type of file.

Compilation and Execution
To compile and run this program, save it as lstat_example.c and use the following commands in your terminal:

gcc -o lstat_example lstat_example.c
./lstat_example <filename>

Replace <filename> with the path to a file or symbolic link you want to examine.

Make sure you have the appropriate permissions to access the file or symbolic link you're querying with lstat().
lstat() system call</p>

<code>
#include <iostream>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    const char* path = "test.txt";  // Change this to your file or symlink

    struct stat fileInfo;

    if (lstat(path, &fileInfo) == -1) {
        perror("lstat");
        return 1;
    }

    std::cout << "File: " << path << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size: " << fileInfo.st_size << " bytes" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Inode: " << fileInfo.st_ino << std::endl;

    if (S_ISLNK(fileInfo.st_mode)) {
        std::cout << "This is a symbolic link." << std::endl;
    } else if (S_ISREG(fileInfo.st_mode)) {
        std::cout << "This is a regular file." << std::endl;
    } else if (S_ISDIR(fileInfo.st_mode)) {
        std::cout << "This is a directory." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Other file type." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
